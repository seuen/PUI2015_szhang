* CLARITY

The visualization (Carbon Emissions per Capita by US County) is clear to read. Legend is helpful with understanding the difference in carbon emissions with each color level.

* ESTHETIC

Color legend is clearly stated with units. However, I believe this visualization could be more visible if some of the important counties could be marked such as New York, Los Angelos, etc.

* HONESTY

The visualization is honestly reproducing the carbon emissions level by county level.

* OTHER SUGGESTION

It might be better to have a comparison with population size by county level.

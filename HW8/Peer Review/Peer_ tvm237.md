* CLARITY

The visualization (Average Income Men and Women Per Race in the U.S.) is clear to read, size font is set properly to help identify each avg income value. In addition, income differences between male and female are clearly stated.

* ESTHETIC

Color setting for each race can help to differentiate values for each race. However, it is not clear enough to differentiate the values between male and female. In fact, I believe this visualization could be more effective and visible if they are plotted using bar graph.

* HONESTY

The visualization is honestly reproducing the average income data.

* OTHER SUGGESTION

It might be better if you can provide a readme.md file for the visualization.

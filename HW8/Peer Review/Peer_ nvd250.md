* CLARITY

The visualization (Apple Stocks vs NASDAQ Composite Index) is very clear to read. The two lines with different slopes are very helpful for readers to better understand the trend of two stock indexes. However, it is better to include max and min values in the visualization.

* ESTHETIC

The visualization is esthetic with two different colors representing two stock indexes. 

* HONESTY

The visualization is honestly reproducing the stock data.

* OTHER SUGGESTION

It is better to have some explainations for sudden drop, highest or lowest values in these trends. In addition, it might be better if you can provide a readme.md file for the visualization.
